# 🎓 Student Management System (Java)

### Overview  
Developed a **Java-based console application** that allows users to **add, view, and delete student records**.  
This project demonstrates the use of **object-oriented programming concepts** such as classes, objects, and collections (`ArrayList`) to manage dynamic student data efficiently.

### 🔧 Features  

- **Add Student**  
  Enter roll number, name, and age to create a new student record.  

- **View All Students**  
  Displays all registered students with their details.  

- **Delete Student**  
  Allows removal of a student record by specifying the roll number.  

- **Exit Option**  
  Gracefully closes the program when the user chooses to exit.

### 💻 Technologies Used  
- **Programming Language:** Java  
- **Concepts Used:**  
  - Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)  
  - ArrayList for dynamic storage  
  - Console-based user input using `Scanner`
